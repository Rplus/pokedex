# svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.technology) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

## Get started

Install the dependencies & copy assets to public folder...

```bash
make init;
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:1510](http://localhost:1510). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

```bash
make deploy
```

ps: Be care of `<base />` tag when develop.
